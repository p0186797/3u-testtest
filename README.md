Create a python file called **triangle.py** and upload it to this repo. 

You have trouble remembering which type of triangle is which. Write a program reads in three angles (in degrees). 
If all three angles are 60, output Equilateral. If the three angles add up to 180 and exactly two of the angles are the same, output Isosceles. If the three angles add up to 180 and no two angles are the same, output Scalene. If the three angles do not add up to 180, output Error.

**Sample Input 1**

```
60
70
50
```

**Sample Output 1**

```
Scalene
```

**Sample Input 2**

```
30
75
75
```

**Sample Output 2**

```
Isosceles
```
